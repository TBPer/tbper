### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Than!

A software engineer specializing in automation and testing. I have almost 10 years of SDET experience working in various types of software testing -- anywhere from e2e UI tests, api/integration tests, load/performance tests, to penetration/secrurity tests (anything with the word "testing" in it). Beyond that, I also have spent a lot of time working as a full stack and a devops engineer.

I like to think of myself as 50% automation, 25% development, 25% devops. 

I'm always intrigued by the software delivery and scalablity, and I believe that `"automating tests is as equally important as automating the process"`. Both speed and efficiency are essential to the quality assurance also. Working closing with development & devops is key of success in test automation.
